summary: Naming conventions for nationally defined FHIR assets
---

In order to promote consistency and make it easier for implementers to locate suitable profiles, extensions, value sets, etc, for their projects, a naming strategy will be adopted for nationally defined FHIR assets. The scope of this document is FHIR STU3.

For detailed definitions of concepts discussed within this guidance document, refer to the appropriate published version of the [FHIR standard].

The keywords MUST, MAY, and SHOULD are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

	heading="FHIR-NAME-01: NHS Digital FHIR Profile names MUST follow an agreed format"
	content="The name of the profile refers to the name.value element in the profile's StructureDefinition and the profile's filename. This section details a set of rules that MUST be followed when creating NHS Digital FHIR profiles. The name of an NHS Digital profile consists of a number of name segments, and will be in the form:-

**[Base]-[BusinessName1]-[BusinessName2]-[FHIRAssetName]-[Version]**

The segments are defined as follows:-

- **Base**: The base profile, if one is used e.g. for a derived profile. This is therefore optional, but mandatory for CareConnect derived profiles.
- **BusinessName1**: The first business name of the profile, which could be a full name or an acronym related to the domain or project name e.g. ITK (Interoperability Toolkit), SPINE. The 
-  name MUST have at least one BusinessName segment. Where an asset may be used across several domains, business names SHOULD reflect that.
- **BusinessName2**: The second business name of the profile. The asset name MAY have a second BusinessName segment. Where there is a second business name, each BusinessName MUST be separated by a hyphen (-) character e.g. 'ADW-Accept'.
- **FHIRAssetName**: The name of the base FHIR asset. Mandatory
- **Version**: This is the major version number of the profile e.g. 'CareConnect-ITK-Encounter-1'. Mandatory

The profile name forms the final segment of the URL of the profile's StructureDefinition and is used to populate its logical id (e.g. the StructureDefinition.id element) on the NHS Digital FHIR Reference server. An example URL for a CareConnect derived profile (STU3) would be https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ITK-Encounter-1, CareConnect-ITK-Encounter-1 being the value of the logical id and the profile's name.

	heading="FHIR-NAME-02: NHS Digital FHIR CodeSystem filenames MUST follow an agreed format"
	content="This section details a set of rules that MUST be followed when creating NHS Digital FHIR CodeSystems. The filename of the CodeSystem consists of a number of name segments and will be in the form:-

**[FHIRAssetName]-[BusinessName1]-[BusinessName2]-[Version]**

The segments are defined as follows:-

- **FHIRAssetName**: The name of the base FHIR asset e.g. CodeSystem. Mandatory
- **BusinessName1**: The first business name of the CodeSystem. The CodeSystem name MUST have at least one BusinessName segment,  e.g. 'CareConnect', 'ITK', 'SPINE'. Where a CodeSystem may be used across several domains, business names should reflect that.
- **BusinessName2**: The second business name of the CodeSystem. The CodeSystem MAY have a second BusinessName segment. Where there is a second BusinessName, each one MUST be separated by a hyphen (-) character. For example 'CodeSystem-SPINE-ErrorOrWarningCode'.
- **Version**: This is the major version number of the CodeSystem e.g. 'CodeSystem-ITK-CareSettingType-1'. Mandatory

The [BusinessName1]-[BusinessName2]-[Version] section of the CodeSystem's filename forms the final segment of its URL and is used to populate its logical id (e.g. the CodeSystem.id element). An example URL for a CodeSystem on the NHS Digital FHIR Reference Server is https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/ITK-CareSettingType-1, ITK-CareSettingType-1 being the value of the logical id.

- **FHIRAssetName**: The name of the base FHIR asset e.g. ValueSet. Mandatory

The [BusinessName1]-[BusinessName2]-[Version] section of the ValueSet's filename forms the final segment of the its URL and is used to populate its logical id (e.g. the ValueSet.id element). An example URL for a ValueSet on the NHS Digital FHIR Reference Server is https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/ValueSet/CareConnect-MedicationDosageRoute-1, CareConnect-MedicationDosageRoute-1 being the value of the logical id.

**[FHIRAssetName]-[Base]-[BusinessName1]-[BusinessName2]-[Version]**

The segments are defined as follows:-

- **Base**: The base extension, if one is used e.g. for a derived CareConnect extension. This is therefore optional, but mandatory for CareConnect derived extensions.

This section details a set of rules that MUST be followed when creating NHS Digital FHIR identifier systems.

	heading="FHIR-NAME-07: General naming conventions MUST also be followed"
	content="The following additional rules MUST also be adhered to for naming NHS Digital FHIR assets:-

- Rule 001: NHS Digital FHIR asset name segments MUST be human understandable. This means that the name must give a clear indication of the purpose or usage of the asset.
- Rule 002: NHS Digital FHIR asset names MUST follow the [Pascal Case capitalization] convention and MUST be in alphanumeric format only. In the [Pascal Case capitalization] convention, the first letter in each segment name and of each subsequent compound word must be capitalised e.g. BackColor.
- Rule 003: To improve the readability of long NHS Digital FHIR asset names, each string segment used to build an NHS Digital FHIR asset name, MUST be separated using the hyphen (-) character. For example :- Base-BusinessName1-BusinessName2-FHIRAssetName-VersionOfProfile or Base-BusinessName1-FHIRAssetName-VersionOfProfile
- Rule 004: CRUD function names MUST NOT be used in NHS Digital FHIR asset names. These are Create, Read, Update and Delete. Other variations should be avoided e.g. Retrieve, Modify, Edit etc.
- Rule 005: All acronyms, with the exception of those which form part of an identifier system business name,  MUST be upper case. For example 'NHS' or 'SDS'. Any acronyms used should be explained in the specification glossary.
- Rule 006: The order of the BusinessName segments when more than one is used SHOULD be logical and meaningful. For example 'ADW-Accept' should be used instead of 'Accept-ADW'
- Rule 007: The asset name MUST have a Version segment. The version number does not have leading or trailing zeros.
